Quarterback Success Based on Hand Size, Height, and Thrown Yards

## Introduction

For this project, the hand size and height of a quarterback will be
evaluated to see if it affected the quarterbackâ€™s ability to succeed in
the NFL. Some of the information was gathered from the project I had
completed in SDS 328M. In addition, more data was combined with data
from a pro football statistics website. This dataset contains statistics
from the majority of all relevant quarterbacks from the past 20 years.
My final sample size is 60 quarterbacks, some of which had to be removed
due to injuries or other outlying factors that massively affected their
data. In the National Football League, a large emphasis is often placed
upon hand size and height of a quarterback when they are being evaluated
to be drafted to professional teams. The data collection was done
through a few websites that have the measurements for quarterback hand
size (inches) and height (inches) on record. The success they have
achieved in the league is being measured by yards thrown per game and
whether the quarterback has an appearance in the Pro Bowl (if the
quarterback makes an appearance in the Pro Bowl, he is usually one of
the five best quarterbacks in that year). My motivation for choosing
this topic is my passion for the sport of football. A positive
correlation between hand size/height and yards per game could be
expected. This data can be used for informational purposes or could even
be used to help gauge future incoming quarterbacks if a correlation was
found.

The mean hand size of the data set is 9.708 inches. The mean height is
75.25 inches. The mean yards per game is 210 yards.The amount of Pro
Bowler quarterbacks is slightly more than non Pro Bowlers.

After running a correlation matrix between all numeric variables, no
real linear relationship is evident between any two numeric variables.

non-correlation is evident in these two scatter plots that compare the

## MANOVA

``` r

```

    ## hand       1 0.01302  0.37597      2     57 0.6883
    ## Residuals 58

After running a MANOVA test, since the p-value is more than the
significance level, there is not a mean difference in either the yards
per game or whether the quarterback made the Probowl for players with
different sized hands.

``` r
summary(manova(cbind(yards,Probowl)~height,data=joinedfootball))

    ##           Df   Pillai approx F num Df den Df Pr(>F)
    ## height     1 0.017951  0.52094      2     57 0.5968
    ## Residuals 58

After running a MANOVA test, since the p-value is more than the
significance level, there is not a mean difference in either the yards
per game or whether the quarterback made the Probowl for players with
different heights.

The assumptions for a MANOVA test include that the data set is made of
random samples and independent observations, has multivariate normality
of the numeric response variables, has homogeneity of within-groups
covariance matrices, has linear relationships among response variables
but no multicollinearity, and no extreme univariate or multivariate
outliers. The assumptions that were met include the random sample and
independent observations, multivariate normality of the numeric response
variables, and homogeneity of within-groups covariance matrices. The
assumptions that were not met include the linear relationships among
response variables but no multicollinearity (there is not a significant
linear relationship among the response variables) and no extreme
univariate or multivariate outliers (contains a few outliers).

After running a linear regression model, neither hand size nor height of
a quarterback significantly predict the average yards per game.
Regardless of the significance, the coefficient for hand size
coefficient states that if your hand size increases by 1 inch, the
average yards per game decreases by 10.25 yards. The coefficient for
height coefficient states that if your height increases by 1 inch, the
average yards per game increases by 1.88 yards.

This logistical regression model is designed to predict whether a
quarterback makes the Probowl based on hand size and height. Both hand
size and height significantly predict whether a quarterback will make
the Probowl. Regardless of the significance, the odds change by a factor
of 0.855 for every inch increase in hand size. The odds change by a
factor of 0.951 for every inch increase in height. This was done by
exponentiating the coefficients.

``` r
joinedfootball$prob <- predict(mymodel2, newdata = joinedfootball, type = "response")
joinedfootball$predicted <- ifelse(joinedfootball$prob > .5, 1, 0)
table(actual = joinedfootball$Probowl, prediction = joinedfootball$predicted)
```

    ##       prediction
    ## actual  0  1
    ##      0  3 25
    ##      1  2 30

This is the confusion matrix for the logistic regression model.

``` r
# sensitivity
mean(joinedfootball[joinedfootball$Probowl == 1,]$prob > .5, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 0.9375

``` r
# specificity
mean(joinedfootball[joinedfootball$Probowl == 0,]$prob <= .5, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 0.1071429

The sensitivity, or the proportion of positive results out of the number
of samples which were actually positive, was a proportion of 0.938 while
the specificity proportion is 0.107.
